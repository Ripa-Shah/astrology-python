# astrology-python
# By this project, I am going to get more exposer in python. 
# Previously, I have used python in car-sales project where I have integrated python with SQL scripts.
# However, this project is mainly focuses on python.
# For that, I have to have basic knowledge of python, panda and numpy.
# Afterwards, to implement this project, it is imperative to learn more about skyfield library and pyephem library.
# By using libraries, I could show the different zodiac effects on person using birth chart.
# It is a fun project for me. 
# I have some knowledge of astrology and I am really excited to implement it into the python
# I hope you would like this project too.
